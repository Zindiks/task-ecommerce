Using css modules styling for this project was kinda bad idea I think.If I would start over I rather try learn and use JSS Styled Components

I haven't use Apollo GraphQL or Opus to query data, fetching data with RTK createAsyncThunk was enough for this task. I used 4 endpoints to get categories,currencies, one product by ID, all product within selected category.

This task was tricky for me to tucle, mostly because I never worked with class components. 
Most difficult thing was to handle selected attributes... but i did it!
