This task was tricky for me to tucle, mostly because I never worked with class components. 
Most difficult thing was to handle selected attributes... but i did it!

I haven't use <strong>Apollo GraphQL</strong> or <strong>Opus</strong> to query data, fetching data with <strong>RTK createAsyncThunk</strong> was enough for this task. I used 4 endpoints to get <i>categories,currencies, one product by ID, all product within selected category.</i>

Using css modules styling for this project was kinda bad idea I think. If I would start over I rather try learn and use JSS Styled Components
