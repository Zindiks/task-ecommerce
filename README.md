This task was tricky for me to tucle, mostly, because I never used to work with class components. 
Most difficult part was to handle selected attributes... btw this task was helpful and I learned a lot

I haven't use <strong>Apollo GraphQL</strong> or <strong>Opus</strong> to query data. Fetching data with <strong>RTK createAsyncThunk</strong> was enough for this task. I used 4 endpoints to get <i>categories,currencies, one product by ID, all product within selected category.</i>
